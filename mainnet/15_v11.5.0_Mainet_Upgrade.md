```

* Further follow the cosmovisor setup guide.

# Setup Cosmovisor

## For installing and creating cosmovisor for the first time [Install](https://github.com/comdex-official/networks/blob/main/testnet/cosmovisor-setup.md). 

### Double check the cosmosvisor enviroment variables and verify if the below variable is added.

```shell
   Environment="UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP=true"
```

## Binary can be obtained in two ways :
   * GitHub Release 
   * Clone the repo, compile from the source

## Download from Github Release

### Download the binary and library from release:

```shell
    wget https://github.com/comdex-official/comdex/releases/download/v11.5.0/comdex-linux-amd64.tar.gz
    tar xf comdex-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```
## Create the updated Comdex binary of v11.5.0

```shell
   mkdir -p ~/.comdex/cosmovisor/upgrades/v11.5.0/bin
```
* Go to comdex directory if present else clone the repository

```shell
   git clone https://github.com/comdex-official/comdex.git
```

* Follow these steps if comdex repo already present

## Check current comdex version
```shell
   cosmovisor version
   # Output should be
   9.1.2
```

```shell
   cd $HOME/comdex
   git pull
   git fetch --tags
   git checkout v11.5.0
   go mod vendor
   make install
```

## Check the new comdex version, verify the latest commit hash

```shell
  name: comdex
   server_name: comdex
   version: v11.5.0
   commit: d7a8b6628909ef08d145d6c217e8c6acb57b5beb
   build_tags: netgo,ledger
   go: go version go1.19.3 darwin/amd64

```

## NOTE: If comdex version shows v11.4.0
## Both the v11.4.0 and v11.5.0 tags were created from the same commit hash (d7a8b6628909ef08d145d6c217e8c6acb57b5beb). This means that the previous tag (v11.4.0) will be installed during the make install process.

```shell
   git tag -d v11.4.0
   make install
```

## Check comdex version again

## Check if the wasm library is linked with the current version 

```shell
   ldd $GOPATH/bin/comdex
   # The output should be:
   go/pkg/mod/github.com/!cosm!wasm/wasmvm@v1.2.1/api/libwasmvm.x86_64.so

   # For using non-static binaries, place your wasmvm file library on /usr/lib (or) /usr/lib64 based on your distro
   cp $GOPATH/pkg/mod/github.com/!cosm!wasm/wasmvm@v1.2.1/api/libwasmvm.x86_64.so /usr/lib
```


## Copy the new comdex(v11.5.0) binary to cosmovisor upgrades directory

```shell
   cp $GOPATH/bin/comdex ~/.comdex/cosmovisor/upgrades/v11.5.0/bin
```

## Start the cosmovisor

```shell
   sudo systemctl start cosmovisor
```
