## Download from Github Release

### Download the binary and libwasmvm library from release:

```shell
    wget https://github.com/comdex-official/comdex/releases/download/v13.2.0/comdex-linux-amd64.tar.gz
    wget https://github.com/comdex-official/comdex/releases/download/v13.2.0/libwasmvm.x86_64.so
    tar -xf comdex-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

### For Debian/Ubuntu based distros

```shell
    sudo cp libwasmvm.x86_64.so /usr/lib/
```

### For RHEL/Fedora/Amazon Linux 2 distros

```shell
    sudo cp libwasmvm.x86_64.so /usr/lib64/
```

## Compiling binary from source

### Create the updated Comdex binary of v13.2.0

```shell
    mkdir -p ~/.comdex/cosmovisor/upgrades/v13.2.0/bin
    cd $HOME/comdex
    git pull
    git fetch --tags
    git checkout v13.2.0
    go mod vendor
    make install
```

## Check the new comdex version, verify the latest commit hash

```shell
    name: comdex
    server_name: comdex
    version: v13.2.0
    commit: 4306f81f754620919874fc5293344482721c50d2
    build_tags: netgo,ledger
    go: go version go1.20.5 darwin/amd64
```

### Check if the wasm library is linked with the current version

```shell
    ldd $GOPATH/bin/comdex version
```

- Output
```shell
    go/pkg/mod/github.com/!cosm!wasm/wasmvm@v1.3.0/api/libwasmvm.x86_64.so
```

### Verify the cosmosvisor current version

```shell
    cosmovisor version
```
- Output
```shell
    v11.5.1
```

## Copy the new comdex(v13.2.0) binary to cosmovisor upgrades directory

```shell
    From source:
        cp $GOPATH/bin/comdex ~/.comdex/cosmovisor/upgrades/v13.2.0/bin

    From the extracted directory of the tar.gz file:
        cp comdex ~/.comdex/cosmovisor/upgrades/v13.2.0/bin
```

## Update minimum-gas-prices in app.toml which defines the minimum gas prices the validator node is willing to accept for processing a transaction

```

    minimum-gas-prices = "0ucmdx"
```

## Check cosmovisor version again

```shell
    cosmovisor version
```
- Output
```shell
    v13.2.0
```

## Restart the cosmovisor

```shell
    sudo systemctl restart cosmovisor
```
