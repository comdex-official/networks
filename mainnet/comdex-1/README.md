# comdex-1 :: First main net.

## Genesis Time
The genesis transactions sent before 1200HRS UTC 18th November 2021 will be used to publish the genesis.json on or before 1805HRS UTC 19th november 2021 and then start the chain at 1400UTC. We will be announcing on all the platforms for the same. Please join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/gH6RTrnexk) and [Comdex-Validators-Group](https://t.me/joinchat/d3WeO-OzYG0zZGFl) to stay updated.

Thank you all for submiting the gentxs. We have received more than 75 gentxs, reviewed and accepted the gentxs of the validators as per the discussion our team had with validators.

> PRE-GENESIS PUBLISHED :: Make sure to replace this genesis with the final genesis, after following the instructions on [Part-2](#launch-instructions).

> FINAL GENESIS :: PUBLISHED

> PEERS :: PUBLISHED

> SEEDS :: PUBLISHED

## Validator setup instructions for validators participating in the genesis

### GenTx : Accepting Now.

* [Install](#installation-steps) comdex core application
* Initialize node

```shell
comdex init "{{NODE_NAME}}" --chain-id comdex-1
```

* Replace the contents of your `${HOME}/.comdex/config/genesis.json` with that of mainnet/comdex-1/pre_genesis.json.

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/comdex-official/networks/main/mainnet/comdex-1/pre_genesis.json
```

* Warning :: Please do not add more than ```10000000ucmdx``` in the genesis account and while gentx.

```shell
comdex add-genesis-account "{{KEY_NAME}}" 10000000ucmdx
```

```shell
comdex gentx "{{KEY_NAME}}" 10000000ucmdx \
--chain-id comdex-1 \
--moniker="{{VALIDATOR_NAME}}" \

For launch, please update to the v0.0.4 tag and rebuild your binaries. Changes in versions 
 - make file refactor to display version and include ldflags.
 - updated IBC version.

* Go to the comdex code repository location. If you are at /home/{username} then below command should work,assuming code was cloned at home location. OR YOU CAN ALSO CHECKOUT OUT THE LATEST CODE BY
```shell
git clone https://github.com/comdex-official/comdex.git
```

* Checkout latest tag : Commit Hash: 43b5ff06c05556b33628dce56cf6b8f9fc92d72e

* Verify version
```shell
comdex version
```
## Verify Your Installation

Verify that everything is OK. If you get something like the following, you've successfully installed comdex on your system.

```shell
v0.0.4
```
If the software version does not match, then please check your $PATH to ensure the correct comdex is running.


## Initialize your node

```shell
comdex init "{{NODE_NAME}}" --chain-id comdex-1
```

## Remove old genesis file

```shell
rm ~/.comdex/config/genesis.json
```

## Download Final Genesis file

You can now download the "genesis" file for the chain. It is pre-filled with the entire genesis state and gentxs. 

```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/comdex-official/networks/main/mainnet/comdex-1/genesis.json > ~/.comdex/config/genesis.json
```

Verify Hash `88b5e9c2dc1b258791ea1fbbe0110b408f36fef7c62ffd2459b44cb000fb16d0`

```shell
jq -S -c -M ' ' ~/.comdex/config/genesis.json | shasum -a 256
```

* Verify the genesis at location `${HOME}/.comdex/config/genesis.json` is replaced with that of mainnet/comdex-1/genesis.json.

* Copy below node as `persistent_peers` in `${HOME}/.comdex/config/config.toml`
 
```shell

### Bootstrap node from state-sync snapshot

```
curl -s https://rpc.comdex.one/status | \ 
 jq '.result .sync_info | {trust_height: .latest_block_height, trust_hash: .latest_block_hash} | values'
```

* Example output:
```
{
  "trust_height": "3549879",
  "trust_hash": "461420F85D8A7A9833B5A1C1E7FCC461AC10247B840C7DD3BB53AC687E3AC0BB"
}
```

##### Set options in config.toml

* Set persistent-peers in config.toml. Seeds node provide list of peers on which there is a snapshots.
```
persistent_peers = "086122c105c4d6e9152bf34558fe49e624ff87fe@13.235.40.129:26656,6ac3ae94528a63f73f5554913927d9d532992288@13.229.39.55:26656,6c1e652e2d9ebf303958e27d939d6167b7528366@99.80.214.210:26656"
```

* Set trust_height and trust_hash values from rpc/status output:
```
[statesync]
enable = true
rpc_servers = "https://rpc.comdex.one,https://rpc.comdex.one"
trust_height = 3549879
trust_hash = "461420F85D8A7A9833B5A1C1E7FCC461AC10247B840C7DD3BB53AC687E3AC0BB"
trust_period = "168h0m0s"
```

### Start comdex node

* Start comdex by running below command for fresh node. If you have used state-sync, don't use unsafe-reset-all. There won't be any data for fresh node, but to be sure please run reset-unsafe as mentioned below.
```shell
comdex unsafe-reset-all
comdex start
```

* Creating a `systemd` service to run comdex in background.

Sample systemd file

```toml
# /etc/systemd/system/comdex.service
[Unit]
Description=Comdex Node
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=ubuntu
WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu
ExecStart=/home/ubuntu/go/bin/comdex start
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=65535

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
## Then update and start node

```shell
sudo -S systemctl daemon-reload
sudo -S systemctl enable comdex
sudo -S systemctl start comdex

To restart -
sudo -S systemctl restart comdex
To Stop -
sudo -S systemctl stop comdex
```
