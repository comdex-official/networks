# Patch upgrade to v6.0.2

## Upgrade time : halt height - 5545662 (around 14:00UTC 16 DEC) and restart to be co-ordinated by all the validators once we have consensus.

## We plan to halt the chain at height 5545662 swap the binaries and restart the chain with new binary once the consensus is reached. If not done this may result into app hash error.

### To halt the node at halt height, please update the below parameter in your app.toml before the halt height or ASAP as you get the announcement

```shell
halt-height=5545662
```

### Restart the node for app.toml changes to take effect

```shell
   sudo systemctl stop cosmovisor
   sudo systemctl start cosmovisor
```

## Step -1 : All upgrades will be done using cosmovisor.

* stop the comdex chain

```shell
   sudo systemctl stop cosmovisor
```

## Copy the updated Comdex binary of v6.0.2 and copy it in v6.0.0 directory of cosmovisor.

* Go to comdex directory if present else clone the repository

```shell
   git clone https://github.com/comdex-official/comdex.git
```

* Follow these steps if comdex repo already present

```shell
   cd $HOME/comdex
   git pull
   git fetch --tags
   git checkout v6.0.2
   go mod vendor
   make install
```

## Check current comdex version
```shell
   cosmovisor version
   # Output should be
   6.0.2
```

## Check the new comdex version, verify the latest commit hash

```shell
  name: comdex
   server_name: comdex
   version: v6.0.2
   commit: 9e8e0074ab71ad846544f1ae740f0a7190fbaa17
   build_tags: netgo,ledger
   go: go version go1.19.3 darwin/amd64

```

## Check if the wasm library is linked with the current version 

```shell
   ldd $GOPATH/bin/comdex
   # The output should be:
   go/pkg/mod/github.com/!cosm!wasm/wasmvm@v1.0.0/api/libwasmvm.x86_64.so

   # For using non-static binaries, place your wasmvm file library on /usr/lib (or) /usr/lib64 based on your distro
   cp $GOPATH/pkg/mod/github.com/!cosm!wasm/wasmvm@v1.0.0/api/libwasmvm.x86_64.so /usr/lib
```


## Copy the new comdex(v6.0.2) binary to cosmovisor v6.0.0 directory

```shell
   cp $GOPATH/bin/comdex ~/.comdex/cosmovisor/upgrades/v6.0.0/bin
```
