# Patch upgrade to v13.4.0

## Please follow instructions from the Step-1 below.

### Upgrade time : Upgrade time : halt height - 6830943 (Dec 23rd 2023 around 11:40â€¯UTC) and restart to be co-ordinated by all the validators once we have consensus

### Pre-requisite
1. Make sure comdex binary is running on [comdex v13.2.0](https://github.com/comdex-official/networks/blob/main/mainnet/16_v13.2.0_Mainet_upgrade.md)

### We plan to halt the chain at height 6830943 swap the binaries and restart the chain with new binary once the consensus is reached. If not done this may result into app hash error.

#### To halt the node at halt height, please update the below parameter in your app.toml before the halt height or ASAP as you get the announcement

```shell
halt-height=6830943
```

### Restart the node for app.toml changes to take effect

```shell
   sudo systemctl stop cosmovisor
   sudo systemctl start cosmovisor
```
    
# Now wait till the halt height 6830943 is reached and please follow the below upgrade steps,
