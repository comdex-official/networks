### For installing and creating cosmovisor for the first time [Install](https://github.com/comdex-official/networks/blob/main/testnet/cosmovisor-setup.md). If not, follow the setup below:

## Binary can be obtained in two ways :

- GitHub Release
- Clone the repo, compile from the source

## IMPORTANT NOTE :

- Keyring is migrated from amino to protobuf, it's recommended you backup your keyring before applying the new application binary. For more details, refer here: [cosmos/cosmos-sdk#9695](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9695)

## Download from Github Release

### Download the binary and libwasmvm library from release:

```shell
    wget https://github.com/comdex-official/comdex/releases/download/v13.0.0/comdex-linux-amd64.tar.gz
    wget https://github.com/comdex-official/comdex/releases/download/v13.0.0/libwasmvm.x86_64.so
    tar xf comdex-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

### For Debian/Ubuntu based distros

```shell
    sudo cp libwasmvm.x86_64.so /usr/lib/
```

### For RHEL/Fedora/Amazon Linux 2 distros

```shell
    sudo cp libwasmvm.x86_64.so /usr/lib64/
```

## Compiling binary from source

### Create the updated Comdex binary of v13.0.0

```shell
    mkdir -p ~/.comdex/cosmovisor/upgrades/v13.0.0/bin
    cd $HOME/comdex
    git pull
    git fetch --tags
    git checkout v13.0.0
    make install
```

## Check the new comdex version, verify the latest commit hash

```shell
  name: comdex
   server_name: comdex
   version: v13.0.0
   commit: 81343d56f7afd3f5986a3e835a1a39c7b82b22ba
   build_tags: netgo,ledger
   go: go version go1.20.5 darwin/amd64

```

### Check if the wasm library is linked with the current version

```shell
    ldd $GOPATH/bin/comdex version
```

- Output
  ```shell
     go/pkg/mod/github.com/!cosm!wasm/wasmvm@v1.3.0/api/libwasmvm.x86_64.so
  ```

### Verify the cosmosvisor current version

```shell
    v11.5.1
```

## Copy the new comdex(v13.0.0) binary to cosmovisor upgrades directory

```shell
   From source:
    cp $GOPATH/bin/comdex ~/.comdex/cosmovisor/upgrades/v13.0.0/bin

   From the extracted directory of the tar.gz file:
    cp comdex ~/.comdex/cosmovisor/upgrades/v13.0.0/bin
```

## Update minimum-gas-prices in app.toml which defines the minimum gas prices the validator node is willing to accept for processing a transaction

```
    eg,
    minimum-gas-prices = "0.00001ucmdx"
```

## Update config.toml as we are reducing the BlockTime

```
    eg,
    timeout_commit = "3s"
```

## Check comdex version again

## Restart the cosmovisor

```shell
   sudo systemctl restart cosmovisor
```
